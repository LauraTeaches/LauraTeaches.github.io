Here are some of the questions I'm asked a lot! If your question isn't answered here, please use the contact information below to get in touch!

Q: When are you available?
A: I mainly teach Monday to Friday 09:00 to  18:00, but I realise that students have to work, and so if you contact me, we may be able to arrange a time outside that works for both of us.

Q: How much do you charge per hour?
A: It depends on what you're learning, whether you're in a group class, and when you want to learn. For more information use the contact information below to ask more.

Q: Do you do discounts?
A: Yes! If you buy a package of courses together, I can offer a discount, the amount depends on the number of lessons. Or if you are registered as a full-time student at a university or school I can offer a 20% discount off full-price classes (not packages).

Q: Where are you based?
A: I am based in Central London, but am happy to travel between Zones 1 - 6, whatever suits you.

Q: What if I am not in London or the UK?
A: I offer online courses, through an online platform. Please contact me for availability of times and prices.
